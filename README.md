## 👨🏻‍🎓🤖 AI-PDF-Extractor
This is a small project I did. It implements the openai-API to summarize the content of a PDf-file of an exam. It will summarize the topic of the exam to tell the user what to focus on while studying for it. I also included a Drag & Drop feature to easily analyze the pdf-File.
